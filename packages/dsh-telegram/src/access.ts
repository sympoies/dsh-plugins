/**
 * Who is allowed to drive the agent.
 *
 * This is the plugin's most security-sensitive decision. A Telegram bot is
 * reachable by anyone who knows its handle, and the agent behind it can run
 * shell commands on the operator's machine. So the default is closed: an
 * unconfigured bot answers nobody until it is claimed once, with a code that
 * is printed to the operator's own console and never sent over Telegram.
 *
 * Ownership is durable and single-shot. Once claimed, a later claim — even
 * with the right code — is refused, so a code that leaks after the fact grants
 * nothing.
