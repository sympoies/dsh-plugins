/**
 * A status file, because the log is not always readable.
 *
 * `ctx.logger` reaches whatever sink the deployment composed — and several
 * profiles compose none, so a plugin that only logs its failures is silent
 * about them. That is how a bot ends up not answering with nothing anywhere
 * to say why: the token was missing, or Telegram refused it, and the one line
 * that said so went nowhere.
 *
 * So the plugin also writes what it is doing to a small JSON file beside its
 * other state. It is written on every transition, is safe to read while the
 * plugin runs, and never contains the token.
