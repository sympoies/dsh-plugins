/**
 * Whether a message in a group was meant for this bot.
 *
 * In a private chat the question does not arise: every message is for the bot,
 * because there is nobody else there. A group is the opposite — people talk to
 * each other all day, and a bot that answers every line is one nobody keeps in
 * the room. Telegram's own convention is the one users already expect: address
 * it by @handle, or reply to something it said.
 *
 * This is separate from access. Access asks whether a person MAY drive the
 * agent and is checked first; this asks whether they were talking to it at all.
 * Conflating them would either let a stranger's @mention through or make the
 * allowlist decide conversational etiquette.
