/**
 * Gathering an album back into one message.
 *
 * Telegram has no "several photos in one message". Sending three screenshots
 * produces three separate updates, tied together only by a shared
 * `media_group_id`, with the caption on exactly one of them. Handled one at a
 * time that becomes three turns: the first carries the question, and the other
 * two arrive as bare images the agent has no reason for.
 *
 * So a message belonging to an album is held briefly rather than answered, and
 * the group is delivered once it stops growing. The wait is the cost: it is
 * paid only by albums, and only once per album, which is a better trade than
 * answering the same question three times.
