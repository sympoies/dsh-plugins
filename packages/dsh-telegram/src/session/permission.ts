/**
 * The permission preset a Telegram conversation runs under.
 *
 * A deployment picks one default for everything it runs, and that choice is
 * usually made for the surface the operator sits in front of: the web UI is
 * loopback-only, with a person watching what the agent does. A Telegram bot is
 * not that. It is reachable from anywhere, gated by a list of user ids, and
 * read on a phone — so the same `danger-full-access` that is merely convenient
 * at a desk is a different proposition over a chat app.
 *
 * This lets the two differ. It is deliberately not a second place to author
 * presets: the names come from the deployment's own table, and all this does
 * is choose among them for conversations that arrive over Telegram.
 *
 * It also decides whether the approval buttons work at all. Under a preset
 * whose approval policy is `never` nothing ever asks, so the buttons this
 * plugin registers can never appear — choosing one that asks is what turns
 * them on.
