 * The store itself is {@link ChatPreferences}: a chat's directory and a chat's

 *
 * A session's cwd is fixed when the session opens; the sandbox derives its
 * writable root from it and the harness calls that root immutable. Changing
 * directory therefore starts a new conversation, which is why the choice
 * cannot live on the session binding that `/new` discards.
