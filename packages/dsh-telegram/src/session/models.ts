/**
 * Choosing which model a Telegram conversation talks to.
 *
 * The web UI has a model picker; a phone had nothing, so every conversation
 * ran on whatever the deployment happened to default to. That is the wrong
 * place to be stuck: the reason to reach for a bot from a phone is often that
 * the question is small and a cheaper model would do, or that it is hard and a
 * better one is worth the wait.
 *
 * The choice is per conversation and durable, so it survives `/new` and a
 * restart. It is applied per turn rather than at session creation, because the
 * harness reads a mutable selection while assembling each step — which is what
 * lets a model change take effect on the very next message.
