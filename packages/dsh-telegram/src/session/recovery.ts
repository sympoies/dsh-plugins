/**
 * Getting a conversation out of a state it cannot leave on its own.
 *
 * Some failures are transient and worth retrying. One is not: a provider
 * inspects the whole request history for images, so once a session's log holds
 * one, every later turn fails on a model that cannot read it — however plain
 * that turn's own text. Retrying is futile, and the user has no way of knowing
 * that from the error, which talks about image input on a message they may
 * have sent an hour ago.
 *
 * The only exit is a new session, and asking the user to remember a command
 * for it is asking them to diagnose the plugin. So the plugin recognises the
 * failure and offers the exit as a button.
