/**
 * dsh-telegram — a Telegram front end for DeepSeek Harness.
 *
 * Two things this plugin does that a plain channel bridge does not:
 *
 * 1. **The agent's markdown arrives as markdown.** Replies are rendered to
 *    Telegram HTML and sent with `parse_mode`, so bold is bold and a code
 *    block is a code block — including while the answer is still streaming.
 * 2. **Questions and approvals can be answered from the chat.** The plugin
 *    registers a `ctx.userQuestions` provider and answers the
 *    `approval/request` waterfall, so `ask_user_question` and a tool that
 *    needs consent both become buttons in Telegram instead of a stall that
 *    only a browser can clear.
 *
 * Everything here is wiring. The behaviour lives in the modules below, each
 * testable without a harness; this file is the single place that touches the
 * live `ctx`.
