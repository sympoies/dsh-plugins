/**
 * Changing which model a live agent's next step runs on.
 *
 * The harness holds one mutable selection object per agent, installed while
 * the agent is still unpublished, and reads `current` each time it assembles a
 * prompt. Mutating that object is how the web UI's model picker changes a
 * running session's model, and it is what lets a conversation carrying an
 * image run somewhere its neighbours do not.
 *
 * `current: undefined` means "no override", so the agent falls back to the
 * route it was created with. That is what makes reverting free: there is
 * nothing to restore, only an override to drop.
 *
 * ## Why this is reproduced rather than imported
 *
 * The harness exports `installModelSelection` from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent`,
 * and importing it would be the obvious thing to do. It cannot be done: under
 * pnpm's isolated layout a plugin resolves only its own declared dependencies,
 * and the harness packages are the host's, not ours. A dynamic import of them
 * fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` every time — which is exactly how this
 * feature came to do nothing at all while looking like it worked.
 *
 * What it does is two listener registrations on the agent's own context, so
 * that is what this does. The coupling is to two event names and their
 * payloads; `test/model-selection.test.ts` pins both.
