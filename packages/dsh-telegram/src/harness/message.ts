/**
 * Building the user message the agent's inbox accepts.
 *
 * `agent.followup()` takes an identified, frozen `UserMessage`. The harness
 * has its own factory for that — `createUserMessage` in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`
 * — and this once tried to import it, preferring the real thing.
 *
 * It never once succeeded. Under pnpm's isolated layout a plugin resolves only
 * its own declared dependencies, and the harness packages belong to the host,
 * so the import failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on every call and this
 * shape was always what got used. Claiming otherwise in a comment made the
 * code harder to reason about, not easier.
 *
 * So the documented shape is the only path, and it is exact: an id, the user
 * role, the content blocks, and a `user` source, deep-frozen before it is
 * handed over.
