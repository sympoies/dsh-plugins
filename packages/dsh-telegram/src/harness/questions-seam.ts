/**
 * Taking over the single user-questions provider without stealing it.
 *
 * `ctx.userQuestions` accepts exactly one provider and throws
 * `DUPLICATE_PROVIDER` on a second registration. In a profile that also runs
 * the web app, the browser has already claimed that slot — so a naive
 * registration here would either fail to load or, worse, silently take every
 * question away from the browser.
 *
 * Instead this seam swaps itself in and keeps the displaced provider as a
 * fallback, so a question belonging to a browser session is forwarded straight
 * back to it. Both surfaces keep working, and whichever one the user is
 * actually looking at is the one that answers.
 *
 * On unload the previous provider is put back, so unloading this plugin
 * restores exactly the arrangement that existed before it loaded.
