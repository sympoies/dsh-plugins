/**
 * Taking a picture of the screen the harness is running on.
 *
 * Useful for the same reason the bot exists at all: the machine is at a desk
 * and you are not. Checking what a long build is showing, or what that dialog
 * says, is otherwise a trip back to the keyboard.
 *
 * It is also the one thing this plugin does that sends the machine's own
 * contents outward without the agent being involved, and a screen holds
 * whatever happens to be on it — an open password manager, someone else's
 * messages, an unrelated customer's data. So it is off unless switched on, and
 * the switch is deliberately a deployment setting rather than a chat command:
 * turning it on should take the same access as configuring the bot.
 *
 * macOS also requires Screen Recording permission for the process that runs
 * the harness. Without it `screencapture` succeeds and returns the desktop
 * picture with no windows, which looks like a broken feature rather than a
 * missing permission — so that case is named rather than shrugged at.
