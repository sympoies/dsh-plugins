/**
 * Choosing which size of a photo to store.

 * The harness attachment seam refuses an image whose longest side is over
 * `maxImageDimension` — 2000 pixels by default. Every modern phone screenshot
 * is over it: 1179×2556 on an iPhone, 1080×2400 on most Android. Taking the
 * largest size Telegram offers, which is what "best quality" naively means,
 * therefore fails for the single most common thing anyone sends a bot.
 *
 * Telegram already solves this. A photo arrives as several rendered sizes, and
 * one of the smaller ones is almost always both within the limit and far more
 * than a model needs to read a receipt. So the largest size that fits is the
 * one to send, and the rest are kept as fallbacks: the limit is the harness's
 * to change, so a rejection is answered by stepping down rather than by
 * trusting the number this side read.
