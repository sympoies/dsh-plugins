/**
 * Keeping the plugin's own prompts inside Telegram's message limit.

 * Agent replies go out as rich messages and get 32768 characters. The prompts
 * this plugin assembles — an approval, a question, a status line — stay on
 * plain HTML and get 4096, and they embed model-authored text of no fixed
 * length: a tool's stated reason, a question's option descriptions.
 *
 * Left unbounded, a verbose reason pushes the message past the limit, the send
 * fails, and the approval fails closed — the agent is refused permission it
 * was never actually asked about, and nobody sees a button. Bounding the
 * inputs is what keeps that from being possible.
 *
 * Escaping is the subtlety: `&` becomes `&amp;`, so escaped text can be five
 * times longer than its source. Cutting after escaping risks splitting an
 * entity, so the text is cut first and escaped afterwards, shrinking until the
 * escaped form fits.
